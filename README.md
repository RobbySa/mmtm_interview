# Frontend

The code version that was completed under 1 hour can be found here: [CodePen link](https://codepen.io/RobbySa/pen/wBGppbe)

## External tools used

TailwindCss for styling\
FontAwesom for the icons

## Disclaimers

I have two separate versions as in order to use TailwindCss in CodePen I had to use their 'play CDN' version which doesn't allow me to abstract away similar patterns into class clusters.

I installed the npm version for the code in the repository which would show a much cleaner version which makes use of the style.css file a lot more.

# Backend

I have created an additional csv file called books_working.csv this is because I structured my code to either successfully import all the lines in the file or none at all.
