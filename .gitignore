/backend_challenge/log/*
/backend_challenge/tmp/*
!/backend_challenge/log/.keep
!/backend_challenge/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/backend_challenge/tmp/pids/*
!/backend_challenge/tmp/pids/
!/backend_challenge/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore storage (uploaded files in development and any SQLite databases).
/backend_challenge/storage/*
!/backend_challenge/storage/.keep
